{title:Description}

{pstd}
The {opt xicor} command 
computes a matrix of xi correlation coefficients 
(Chatterjee, 2021).

{pstd}
The xi correlation matrix is not symmetric. 
The rows of the matrix represent Xs 
and the columns of the matrix represent Ys. 
Thus, the correlation coefficient xi(X_i,Y_j) 
is found in the {it:i}th row and {it:j}th column. 

{pstd}
Ties in the values of {it:varlist} are broken randomly (see {help sort}). 
Therefore in the presence of ties, 
the xi correlation coefficients are random. 
More specifically, the xi correlation coefficients 
depend on the current sort order of the data and 
on the {help sortseed:sortseed}.
For more than two variables, the xi coefficients 
also depend on the order of variables in {it:varlist}. 
Last, the xi correlation coefficient 
might depend on the {help set_sortmethod:sort method}.

R code from
{browse "https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/XICOR/index.html":Holmes & Chatterjee (2023)} 
was helpful for clarifying some details in Chatterjee (2021).

Part of the code is adapted from StataCorp
